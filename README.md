# Rocchio-Algorithm-Implementation-for-Relevance-feedback-in-Information-Retrieval
This repository has codes for implementing Rocchio Algorithm using both Tf-IDF and Word2Vec embedding. We also implement the algorithm using Query Expansion 

## Rocchio Algorithm formula:

## Dataset source
Dataset has been taken from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JuawXQmYVkjpfL3H0blqjDrqw8V1lHrC

## Query Format
Queries are of the form of XML File and we just extract text with the <desc> </desc> tags

## Document Format
Documents are of the form of XML File and we just extract text with the <TEXT> </TEXT> tags

## Pre-Processing
Document and Query Tokens have been Extracted in PreProcessing.ipynb file and stored in different csv files
